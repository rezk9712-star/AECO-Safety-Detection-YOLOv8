# Error Analysis & Data Improvement Plan

## 🔍 False Positive (FP) Analysis
*The model "hallucinated" an object or misclassified background noise.*

| ID | Image Reference | Predicted Class | Actual Object | Root Cause Hypothesis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| FP1 | [Pending] | | | |
| FP2 | [Pending] | | | |
| FP3 | [Pending] | | | |

## 🙈 False Negative (FN) Analysis
*The model failed to detect an object that was clearly present.*

| ID | Image Reference | Missed Class | Condition | Root Cause Hypothesis |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| FN1 | [Pending] | | | |
| FN2 | [Pending] | | | |
| FN3 | [Pending] | | | |

## 🛠️ Prioritized Next Data Improvements
*Based on the failures above, these are the top 3 concrete steps to improve the model.*

1. **[Improvement 1]:** e.g., Increase dataset diversity for [Confused Class].
2. **[Improvement 2]:** e.g., Add negative samples to reduce false detections on [Background Object].
3. **[Improvement 3]:** e.g., Use Brightness Augmentation to handle low-light site conditions.
