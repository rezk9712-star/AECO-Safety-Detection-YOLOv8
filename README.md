# AECO-Safety-Detection-YOLOv8
The Problem: Why are we doing this? (e.g., "Manual safety monitoring on AECO sites is slow and prone to human error.")
The Goal: "To develop a YOLOv8 model that identifies [Class A] and [Class B] with high reliability.
"Success Metric: Define a target. (e.g., "We aim for a Mean Average Precision ($mAP@50$) of 0.75 or higher.")
